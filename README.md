Different types of ML Algorithms are
1.	Supervised Learning
2.	Unsupervised Learning
3.	Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning are Data + Label. They are used for any classification problems.
Unsupervised Learning are data. They are used for any clustering problems.

Machine Learning Pipeline
1 Define a ML problem
2 Collect the data
3 Extract features
4 Predict output
